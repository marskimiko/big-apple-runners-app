# Blogpost inspired by building Big Apple Runners

# Project Philosophy: 

Big Apple Runngers is an application built for runners to find routes in NYC and write reviews on them to share with eachother. As a runner in NYC finding it hard to find good places to run in such an urban environment I was inspired to create a space for runners to share the findings and experiences with eahother.

# Features:

- Upon loading the website it takes you to the home page with instructions to login or signup in order to have access to the rest of the application
- Once you do so the hope page will load to say "Welcome, (yourname)! click routes in the nav or below to see all routes" 
- Once you click on routes you will be able to see all of the routes that have been added so far
- Each route has a "more info" button, which upon clicking takes you to a details page for the specific routes with more info about the route as well as reviews on the route written by users
- A review will only have the ability to be edited or deleted if it has be written by the user who is currently signed in. You also have the ability to write additional reviews at the bottom of the pge
- In the navigation there is also a "New Route" button that allows anyone to add more routes
- There is also a "My Routes" button in the navigation that upon clicking will take you to a page that shows only routes the user has reviewed
